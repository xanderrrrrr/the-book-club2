## Project description:
This app allows you to manage your book clubs, the members that belong to them, the books they are reading/listening to, and how many hours/pages that must be read/listened to per day in order to be finished by the next meetup.  Typically we just relied on memory to achieve this as well as facebook messages for recorded history.

This app has user authentication allowing a new user to sign up.   They then can then enter in a book club name that they're a part of. They can then add the members of the group. Afterward for each member they can add books with the duration and next meetup date. The system then calculates how much you need to listen to per day in order to finish the book by the next meetup date.
